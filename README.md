# Ultra-trail running

The data this week was collected from [the website of the International Trail Running Association (ITRA)](https://itra.run/Races/FindRaceResults), which compiles the results of trail running races from 2012 to 2021. This data set focuses more specifically on the most iconic races of the discipline: 100 miles races. 

In these physically and mentally demanding races, it is not unusual to see women winning, [as women may be faster than men over long distances](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/news/a36528666/ultrarunning-more-popular-than-ever/). As a first example of data processing, you will see [here](https://bjnnowak.netlify.app/2021/09/18/r-web-scraping-with-rvest/) that in 2021, on average, women were faster than men to finish the UTMB (Chamonix, France), one of the most famous races of ultra-trail running.
