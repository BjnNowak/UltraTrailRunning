# Ultra-trail running

The data this week was collected from [the website of the International Trail Running Association (ITRA)](https://itra.run/Races/FindRaceResults), which compiles the results of trail running races from 2012 to 2021. This data set focuses more specifically on the most iconic races of the discipline: 100 miles races. 

In these physically and mentally demanding races, it is not unusual to see women winning, [as women may be faster than men over long distances](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/news/a36528666/ultrarunning-more-popular-than-ever/).
